Code through journaling? Journaling through code?

This is GitHub! Github is great.
GitHub is a platform by which computer code can be both shared for others to be used, and collaboratively written. It’s free to create an account, which you don’t even need if you are only interested in looking and using the information on it.

The platform is completely agnostic of any specific programming languages, and can be used to disseminate, and collaborate work on, any form of textual information (as proved by the fake piece of code that I made for this project).

It is my personal belief that with programming becoming ever more relevant in today’s world, educators have the responsibility to identify it, just like any other language, as a useful and content-area-agnostic skill. As more and more content, of all kinds, become digitally disseminated and consumed, and with the complexities of volume, and concerns for authenticity, that it brings with it, virtually every content area could potentially benefit from the understanding and implementation of programming skills. Just like any other language, it provides the opportunity for individuals to engage with more information, in richer ways.

GitHub is a great (though not the only) tool to create collaborative and simple programming projects in the classroom. A teacher could create a coding template, that is either meant to actually work or not, and then let student create “branches” out of that template as they build their own projects. Following that, the teacher has the choice to merge those branches back into the “trunk” template, to incorporate those changes. All these processes are imbedded into GitHub’s design, and allows it to support projects of an infinite diversity of complexities.

As I’ve probably expressed in class too many times, I fervently believe that as a rule, technology should be implemented in the classroom to serve a teaching and learning function, and no the other way around. Programming, however, is very much an exception to this stance. Programming is a language, and while it is bound to technological implementation, it also holds its own inherent educational value. Learning to code it learning how to engage fully with the world around us, and so just as we would not neglect opportunities for language learning in any content, we ought also not neglect opportunities for programming.

Afterword:

This is not a ‘proper’ GitHub readme, which would usually describe the purpose and function of the project it’s in. The .ede492 file is meant to depict a comical ‘pseudo-code’ to illustrate how GitHub functions.
